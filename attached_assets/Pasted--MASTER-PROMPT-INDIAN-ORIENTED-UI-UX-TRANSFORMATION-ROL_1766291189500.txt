🇮🇳 MASTER PROMPT — INDIAN-ORIENTED UI & UX TRANSFORMATION
ROLE & MINDSET (MANDATORY)

You are a Senior Frontend Architect and Product Designer with deep experience building agri-tech platforms for Indian farmers.

You understand:

Indian agriculture workflows

Indian geography, crops, seasons, and terminology

Government-backed agri-tech expectations

UX suitable for Indian users (clarity > fancy design)

You must retain the existing architecture, logic, and approach
and only localize, contextualize, and humanize the system for India.

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Transform the entire Smart Irrigation Dashboard so it feels:

Built for Indian farmers

Relevant to Indian agriculture

Familiar in language, units, crops, and geography

⚠️ DO NOT change the core logic, services, or architecture
⚠️ DO NOT Americanize anything (locations, crops, units, seasons)

🌾 INDIAN CONTEXT REQUIREMENTS (CRUCIAL)
1️⃣ Geography & Location

Replace all American-based references.

❌ Mendocino Valley, CA
❌ Acres-only assumptions

✅ Indian villages / districts
Examples:

Nashik, Maharashtra

Warangal, Telangana

Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu

Ludhiana, Punjab

Use:

Village / Taluka / District / State format

2️⃣ Units & Measurements

All measurements must be Indian-standard:

Land Area:

Acres (primary)

Hectares (secondary)

Temperature:

Celsius (°C)

Rainfall:

Millimeters (mm)

Water:

Liters

Fertilizer:

kg / hectare

3️⃣ Crops (Indian-First)

Replace generic crops with Indian staple crops:

Examples:

Rice (Paddy)

Wheat

Cotton

Sugarcane

Soybean

Tomato

Onion

Groundnut

Maize

Crop selection must align with:

Indian seasons

Irrigation styles

Soil types

4️⃣ Crop Seasons (VERY IMPORTANT)

Replace Western “growing season” ideas with:

Kharif

Rabi

Zaid

These must be used:

In onboarding

In crop logic

In UI labels

5️⃣ Soil & Water Context (India-specific)

Soil types:

Black soil (Regur)

Red soil

Alluvial soil

Sandy soil

Laterite soil

Water sources:

Borewell

Open well

Canal

Tank / Lake

Rain-fed

6️⃣ Farmer Profile Localization

Farmer onboarding must reflect Indian realities:

Name

Mobile number (optional)

State & District

Experience:

New farmer

Experienced farmer

Preferred language:

English

Hindi

(future: Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, etc.)

Avoid corporate wording.
Use simple, respectful language.

🎨 UI & COPY CHANGES (KEEP DESIGN, CHANGE FEEL)
Tone

Simple

Respectful

Practical

Trust-building

Examples:

❌ “System Status: Online”
✅ “System Status: Active”

❌ “Autonomous Mode Enabled”
✅ “Automatic Mode चालू है” (optional bilingual hint)

❌ “Audit Trail”
✅ “System Record (Verified)”

🧾 Dashboard Content Localization
Header

“Smart Irrigation Dashboard”
→ “Smart Krushi Dashboard” / “Smart Irrigation System”

Footer

Mention:

“Designed for Indian farming conditions”

“Supports water-efficient agriculture”

🔐 Blockchain Explanation (India-relevant)

Explain blockchain not as crypto, but as:

“Tamper-proof digital record for farming actions, useful for audits, trust, and future government or buyer verification.”

Avoid crypto jargon.

🧪 DEMO DATA (IMPORTANT)

All mock data must be Indian-looking:

Names: Ravi Patil, Suresh Yadav, Anil Reddy

Farms: “Patil Farm – Nashik”

Crops: Cotton / Soybean

Seasons: Kharif

Weather: 32°C, Monsoon rain probability

⚙️ WHAT MUST NOT CHANGE

❌ Service Layer Pattern
❌ Context API usage
❌ Mock → Real API switch
❌ Auth architecture
❌ Component structure

Only:
✅ Labels
✅ Data values
✅ Copy
✅ Defaults
✅ UI tone

🧪 VALIDATION REQUIREMENT

Before finalizing:

Review UI like an Indian farmer would

Remove all American assumptions

Ensure all units & seasons are Indian

Ensure language is simple and respectful

If unsure:
👉 Ask before implementing

🎯 FINAL EXPECTATION

At the end, the dashboard should feel like:

“This system was built for Indian farmers, not adapted later.”

Judges should subconsciously think:

“This actually understands Indian agriculture.”

If you want next:

I can rewrite all UI copy in Indian tone

Or create a bilingual (English + Hindi) version

Or align this with Indian government agri schemes

Just tell me 👍
